# 🚀 Rocket Science

Welcome to **Rocket Science**, an open-source project dedicated to building advanced rocketry systems. This project integrates hardware and software components to enable real-time data processing, telemetry, and control for high-performance flight applications.

## 🌍 Overview
Rocket Science is designed to provide a complete solution for rocketry enthusiasts, engineers, and researchers. It includes:

- **On-Board Computer** – A flight computer that processes sensor data, and executes flight algorithms.
- **Hardware Schematics** – Detailed circuit designs and PCB layouts for all essential components.
- **Sensor Fusion & Navigation** – **Kalman Filter** integrating multiple sensors (IMUs, barometers, GPS) for accurate positioning.
- **Ground Telemetry** – A real-time data transmission and visualization system for monitoring flight parameters from the ground.
- **Radio Communication** – Implementation of LoRa-based communication between the rocket and ground station.
